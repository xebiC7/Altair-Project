# Altair-Project
Altair: A decentralized, multi-agent AI framework for private and offline intelligence, developed entirely on Android.
Note: Certain core modules of V7 are kept private due to their powerful nature and security implications. This repository showcases the Architecture and Orchestration logic only
​1. Education for All (Bridge the Digital Divide)
​Cost-Free Learning: No data plans required. High-quality AI guidance on a mobile phone.
​The Pocket Mentor: Transform any PDF textbook into an interactive tutor using local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
​Instant Insight: Ask questions, get context-aware answers directly from local documents without reading thousands of pages.
​2. Healthcare & Emergency Response
​First Aid in the Wild: Providing life-saving guidance in remote areas without doctors or internet access.
​The Offline Intelligence Cloud: Using mesh networking/SDR so a single AI node can serve an entire village with medical knowledge.
​3. Agriculture & Local Productivity
​Expert Advisor for Farmers: Localized AI knowledge on pest control and sustainable farming methods.
​Knowledge Exchange: Enabling AI nodes to share specialized knowledge (e.g., Livestock AI syncing with Farming AI) to boost community-wide production.
